                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Booking & Payment:</strong> A booking is considered confirmed only after a deposit is made. The remaining balance is due upon completion of the move. Accepted payment methods include bank transfer, mobile money, or cash.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Rescheduling:</strong> If you need to reschedule your move, please inform us at least 48 hours in advance. Rescheduling with less than 48 hours notice may incur an additional fee.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Allowed Items:</strong> Our company moves typical household items, including furniture, appliances, clothes, and personal effects. Items should be securely packed to prevent damage during the move.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Prohibited Items:</strong> Hazardous items like chemicals, explosives, flammable goods, live plants, pets, and perishable foods are prohibited. Any valuables, such as cash or jewelry, should be disclosed in advance if included in the move.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Delays & Unexpected Events:</strong> While we strive to be punctual, unforeseen events such as traffic delays, weather conditions, or accidents may cause delays. We will keep you informed of any changes in schedule. No refunds will be issued for delays caused by such events.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Fragile & Valuable Items:</strong> Clients must inform us in advance about fragile or valuable items, such as artwork, electronics, or antiques, that require special handling. We are not responsible for damages to such items unless they are packed by us.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Insurance can be arranged upon request to cover items during the move, especially for high-value goods. Please notify us in advance if you require this service.</li>

                    <li><strong>Special Equipment & Heavy Items:</strong> For large or heavy items, such as pianos, safes, or other bulky equipment, special equipment or additional movers may be required. These services will incur an additional charge.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Access to Building/Unit:</strong> It is the client’s responsibility to ensure that there is sufficient access to buildings or units for the moving team. This includes working elevators, stairways, and any required permits for moving trucks. Delays caused by access issues may incur additional charges.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Liability:</strong> While we take great care in handling your belongings, the company’s liability for damage or loss is limited. Clients are encouraged to consider insurance for valuable or delicate items.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Cancellations & Delays:</strong> Cancellations made within 24 hours of the move may incur a cancellation fee. If the move is delayed due to client-related issues, additional charges may apply.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Arrival Times:</strong> We strive to adhere to the scheduled arrival times for your move. However, delays may occur due to traffic, weather, or other unforeseen circumstances. We will notify you promptly of any significant delays.</li>
